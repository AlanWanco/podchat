# PomChat Studio

PomChat Studio is a desktop-first tool for turning local audio and ASS subtitles into chat-style dialogue videos.

It supports subtitle editing, speaker styling, layout preview, and video export in one project.

Chinese README: `README.md`

## What It Does

- Import local audio and ASS subtitle files
- Edit subtitle lines, timing, speaker mapping, and text
- Configure speaker avatars, names, colors, padding, shadows, and animation
- Preview the conversation layout in real time while the audio plays
- Export a video with a selected time range and filename template
- Save project data locally and sync project-related config through Electron

## Main Features

- **Subtitle editing**: add, remove, sort, and update subtitle lines
- **Speaker styling**: customize avatars, bubble colors, fonts, borders, spacing, and theme
- **Layout control**: adjust canvas size, padding, bubble scale, avatar size, and annotation position
- **Playback tools**: scrub audio, loop playback, remember position, and set export range quickly
- **Video export**: render chat-style video output from the current project configuration

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Start development

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Basic Usage

## Build

Build the app bundles:

```bash
npm run build
```

Build an Electron package locally:

```bash
npm run dist
```

Packaged files are written to `release/`.

## GitHub Actions

This repository includes Electron build and manual release workflows:

- `Build Electron Apps`: multi-platform build artifacts
- `Release Electron Apps`: manually create and upload release assets

## Project Structure

- `src/App.tsx`: main application flow and preview integration
- `src/components/`: editor panels, player, export modal, and shared chat UI
- `src/remotion/`: Remotion export composition and types
- `src/hooks/useAssSubtitle.ts`: ASS parsing and subtitle loading
- `electron/`: Electron main process, preload script, and render worker
- `.github/workflows/`: CI build and release workflows

## Notes

- The app is mainly optimized for local desktop usage through Electron
- Some Electron settings are still development-oriented and may be tightened later
